### About the talk:

Metrics that Matter: Empowering your QA Function with data
• Say goodbye to waterfall metrics and bug counts
• Examining the Accelerate metrics: how they boost profit, markets share and team morale
• Learning from stories of WW2 warplanes; fables from Soviet Russia, delving into Goodhart's Law, Campbell's Law and common metric traps
• Aligning metrics with your team mission and goals, and measuring what truly matters
• Demonstrating a Grafana dashboard to visualise these metrics, and infuse them into your teams culture - with a sample repo to takeaway and clone after the event
An opportunity to reconsider your approach to QA metrics and network with like minded professionals.
