### About the talk:

Pitfalls, Perils and Traps: How to Avoid Them as a Modern Test Engineer.

Every day, all over the world, testers at different levels of their career are trying to avoid common traps, pitfalls and perils of testing.

The first step in avoiding them is recognising and understanding them. I myself have fallen into these traps, often repeatedly, unaware that it was happening and becoming ever increasingly frustrated and unhappy as a result of it. Yes, we are our own worst enemy sometimes.

In this talk we will identify common traps that we fall into as testers, such as enabling the team to see test as an afterthought, being snowed under with tick box tasks or feeling like only you value quality.
Showing that by adjusting practices and thought processes in small ways, thinking like a modern test engineer, we can set ourselves free or avoid the traps completely.

Covering topics from valuing ourselves, being proactive rather than reactive, making testing fun, being positive and becoming a quality coach.
