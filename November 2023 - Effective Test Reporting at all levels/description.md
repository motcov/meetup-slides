### About the talk:

Effective Reporting at all levels : Harnessing the Power of the Reporting Pyramid

Learn how to create test reports which build trust, show progress and indicate the products quality.

The more that testing happens, the more reports are created. We've all been there at one point or another, filing test reports away and wondering if anyone actually reads them. The primary reason that reports aren't read? Information overload. The consumer gets overwhelmed having to find and process key information. The result?

They just stop consuming it and confidence is lost. Often resulting in weekly status update meetings, so they feel like they're back in control again. To avoid this, I've identified the needs of the primary consumer of your report (aka customer). As a tester, you are well versed in getting to know your customer, thinking like them, empathising and making sure their needs are satisfied. So let's utilise that super power and put it to good use when creating reports. So what's this reporting pyramid all about? Surely we don't need another pyramid! You're right, we don't need two, let's ditch the other one.

The reporting pyramid shows you the level of detail you need to include in your report, based on the seniority of the consumer. From reporting defects to the dev team, all the way up to reporting on quality to stakeholders. Are there any other magic tricks involved? Yes. I'll show you how to use progress indicators and action items to slim line your reports and deliver key information effectively. Saving you and the consumer time and building trust.
